Functioning of react through basic react modules

1. src/index.js is the main file which gets displayed (node functionality)

2. import App from './App' goes to src/App.js where it returns a function App

3. the function app returns the html content written it the return block 

4. const root is a react dom object created through react-dom library

5. this library gets an element 'root' from public/index.html

6. the function App is rendered to the html page and hence the html code stored is returned to the webpage


** capitalize function file names and fucntion names too
