# Daily Progress in WebDev

## Day 1
- Learned the basics of React on why and how to use it
- Implemented simple projects using basic React and vite React

---

## Day 2
- Learned the functionality of React and its libraries using both basic react and vite react
- Made custom react using sole HTML and JS (tried cloning react libraries)

---

## Day 3
- Learned about react fibres 
- Learned and implemented hooks, state and counter
- Learned using tailwind CSS and hence made a simple vite react project implementing it

## Day 4
- Tried to implement a project using tailwindcss but failed to do so because error coming while installing tailwind with vite

## Day 5
- Implemented background changer using onclick, hooks, counter in vite react project and tailwind css

## Day 6
- Learned about different hooks : useId, useCallback, useEffect, useRef
- Learned making and implementing custom hooks
- Made a project, Password Generator, which generates password in real time with toggle options like characters, numbers, length. Also 'Copy Password' feature added

- It has an 'user' endpoint for handling params

## Day 8
- Learned about the requirement of Context API, what it is and various ways in which it is implemented.

- Learned basics of typeScript

## Day 10
- Learned intermediate typescript

## Day 11

## Day 12

## Day 13
- From quite a lot of days, I have been working on a new project of mine inspired from asana, trello, etc.
- Till now, I have developed the authentication system, organisation routes and logic, and almost all database schemas and relations required.
- I am keeping in mind the production level code structure, modularity and scality using dynmatic routing and folders.
- The backend is to be made using nodeJs, expressJs, and required libraries and frameworks like jsonwebtoken, bcryptjs, dotenv, cookie-parser (as of now); the frontend using reactJs and related frameworks; database I am using is postgreSQL and Prisma ORM.

## Note
- Was inactive due to critical health conditions and hence this personal break. 
- Meanwhile, I created a project for Vardhman Air Solutions and got a certification for it (defenceCompany repo).
- I learned PostgreSQL and using it through Prisma ORL.
- Also created personal React Projects for practice.
- Will try my best to be consistant throughout this journey and not to repeat such a thing.
